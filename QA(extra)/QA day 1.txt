------why testing?
to identify defects
to reduce flaws in the component or system
increase the ease of use if the software
software test help accelerate development	//dev phase mai bugs bhetyo bhane sajilo huncha


------Testing and debugging
testing: dev sake pachi testing period ma garni
debugging: at the time of coding each line ma code check garni 


------Quality assurance
focused on adherence to proper processes, in order to provide confidence that the appropriate level of quality will e achieved

error: mistake, misunderstanding misconception on part id software dev
defect: a deviation from expected sw behavior caused by error
failure: inability of a sw system or component to perform as required
root cause: causes of defects are the earliest actions or conditions the contributed the defects
effect: impact caused by defect

------testing types

-- white-box testing: code, archi, dataflow saab tha hunu parcha
----unit, testing for memory leaks, penetration testing(eeuta dfeature ko root cause/ kun felid ma issue cha tyo check garni), path testing(app ko flow kasto cha, kun flow garda kun error aayo tyo check garna testing garni)

--Black-box testing: no knowledge of code, high lvl of testing that focuses on  the behavior of the sw
----Functional testing, non-functional testing, regression testing(overall testing, highlevel ma)
----functional testing:
(unit testing, smoke(existing features testing) regression, sanity(new feature test), integration, API, UI) 

----Non-functional testing: 
evaluates the characteristics, usability, performance, compatability "how well' the sys behaves
(performance, stress, load, volume (kati data halda kasto performance/reaction dincha), security, upgrade & installation test(backward compatibility testing, paila ko existing form haru chalcha ki chaina), recovery testing(delete bhako data recover huncha ki not check))

------Change-related testing
kunai new change le old component lai effect garira cha ki chaina , old and new properly chalnu parryo as per the requirement, intreelates companents
(functional testing, smoke testing , sanity testing, regression testing, build verification test(kunai specific build nai check garni kk changes cha saab, v1 cha bhane v2 test nagarni v1 nai test garni)


------Testing technioques
protocol to design a better test case and shape a proper testing workflow


SIT UAT TEST ENVIRONMENT
user acceptance testing
